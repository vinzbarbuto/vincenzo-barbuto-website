abstract: The Edge Intelligence (EI) paradigm has recently emerged as a promising solution to overcome the inherent limitations of cloud computing (latency, autonomy, cost, etc.) in the development and provision of next-generation Internet of Things (IoT) services. Therefore, motivated by its increasing popularity, relevant research effort was expended in order to explore, from different perspectives and at different degrees of detail, the many facets of EI. In such a context, the aim of this paper was to analyze the wide landscape on EI by providing a systematic analysis of the state-of-the-art manuscripts in the form of a tertiary study (ie, a review of literature reviews, surveys, and mapping studies) and according to the guidelines of the PRISMA methodology. A comparison framework is, hence, provided and sound research questions outlined, aimed at exploring (for the benefit of both experts and beginners) the past, present, and future directions of the EI paradigm and its relationships with the IoT and the cloud computing worlds.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Edge Intelligence (EI) is a new solution for improving IoT services by overcoming cloud computing limitations. To analyze this field, this paper provides a systematic analysis of existing studies using the PRISMA methodology. The paper outlines research questions to explore the past, present, and future directions of EI, as well as its relationship with IoT and cloud computing.
