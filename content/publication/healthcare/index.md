abstract: In the Healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT), wearable devices play a vital role in continuously monitoring patient vital signs but they commonly rely on an associated device—like smartphone or local base station—for data collection, processing, communication, or alert generation. This dependency compromises service continuity in the event of connectivity issues or unexpected lack of resources, due to limited mechanisms of pairing or offloading. Therefore, we present an HIoT architecture that enables continuous data collection, dynamic device association, and hybrid device-edge-cloud real-time processing, ensuring robustness and effectiveness even under challenging, evolving conditions. By combining the capabilities of wearable devices with Cloud technologies like Amazon Web Services, the proposed architecture is fault-tolerant, highly available, and compliant with security standards, thus resulting well-suited to ensure continuous healthcare services in real-world applications.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In the Healthcare IoT (HIoT), wearables often depend on companion devices for data handling, which risks service disruption during connectivity or resource failures. To address this, a new HIoT architecture is proposed that supports continuous data collection, dynamic device association, and hybrid device–edge–cloud processing. Leveraging wearables and cloud services (e.g., AWS), it ensures fault tolerance, high availability, security compliance, and continuous healthcare services under dynamic conditions.
