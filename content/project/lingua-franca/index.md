title: Lingua Franca
summary: Lingua Franca (LF) is a polyglot coordination language designed to enhance mainstream programming languages (currently **C**, **C++**, **Python**, **TypeScript**, and **Rust**) with deterministic reactive concurrency and timed behavior capabilities. Supported by a robust runtime system, LF enables concurrent and distributed execution of reactive programs deployable on the Cloud, the Edge, and even bare-metal embedded platforms.
