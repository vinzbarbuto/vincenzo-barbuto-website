              I designed and implemented a traffic monitoring system based on digital twin technology. This system detects and counts vehicles in real-time, monitors traffic pollution, and measures environmental parameters. This experience allowed me to specialize in creating, querying, and managing digital twins. I also gained expertise in general-purpose and synthetic sensing techniques, as well as in reverse digital twin creation.
