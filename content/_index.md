      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My research focuses on <b style="color: #6ee7b7;">Edge Intelligence</b>, an emerging field at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and edge computing. Specifically, I investigate intelligent devices and systems capable of processing data locally, reducing reliance on cloud-based services. My goal is to understand how these devices can seamlessly integrate into complex cyber-physical systems, ranging from <b style="color: #6ee7b7;">intelligent traffic monitoring</b> to <b style="color: #6ee7b7;">emergency vehicle detection</b>.
        {style="font-size: 1rem;text-align: justify"}

        This includes exploring efficient machine learning and AI algorithms tailored for edge deployments, evaluating their trade-offs in terms of <b style="color: #6ee7b7;">latency, energy efficiency, and computational cost</b>. Additionally, I examine the broader impact of Edge AI on real-time decision-making and autonomous operations, particularly in environments where <b style="color: #6ee7b7;">network constraints, security, and reliability</b> are critical factors.
        {style="font-size: 1rem;text-align: justify"}

        Beyond Edge Intelligence, I am also interested in <b style="color: #6ee7b7;">Digital Twins</b>, digital counterparts of physical systems. My research aims to <b style="color: #6ee7b7;">enhance their usability beyond simple mirroring</b>, enabling predictive modeling, adaptive control, and resilient system design. By integrating Digital Twins with Edge AI, I explore how <b style="color: #6ee7b7;">distributed intelligence</b> can improve system robustness, optimize resource allocation, and facilitate dynamic decision-making in real-world applications.
